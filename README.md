# ðŸ§  Ensemble Learning with Multi-Model Predictions

This project explores different approaches to implementing ensemble learning techniques. Our goal was to understand how multiple models can be combined effectively to improve prediction performance, reliability, and flexibility.


## âœ… Key Highlights

- Supports **multiple ensemble strategies** like Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking  
- Handles **multiple trained models** in a modular setup  
- Includes a **simple prediction interface** with fallback logic  
- Demonstrates **A/B testing** to explore performance variations  


## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcome

This exercise helped us explore practical aspects of ensemble learning, such as combining outputs, implementing fallback logic, testing model strategies, and organizing modular ML code.
